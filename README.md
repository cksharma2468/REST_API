ðŸ‘‰ **Project Overview:**

This repository contains the code for my project, which involves developing a RESTful API. An API allows clients to interact with your application's data. I have implement endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data.
REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (or REST API) is an interface that allows systems to communicate over the HTTP protocol following REST principles.

* **Functionalities**:-

 * Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client between requests.

 * Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities, each with its own responsibilities. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for processing requests and managing resources.

 * Uniform Interface: A uniform and consistent way of interacting with resources is maintained. This includes the use of standard conventions for resource identification (URI), representation of resources (using media types), and stateless communication.

 * Resource-Based: Resources are the key abstraction in REST. Every entity, concept, or piece of information that can be named can be a resource. Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

 * CRUD Operations: RESTful APIs typically support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources. HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are commonly used to map to these CRUD operations.

ðŸ‘‰ **Getting Started:**

[Explain how to set up and run your project. This may include instructions on installing dependencies, running the server, and accessing the API.]

ðŸ‘‰ **API Documentation:**

[Yet to be added. Feel free to add docs if you want to contribute.]

ðŸ‘‰ **Testing with Postman:**

[Explain how to test your API using Postman. This may include instructions on importing a Postman collection, setting up environment variables, and running the tests.]

* Link to or include the Postman collection file (`*.json`) in the repository.
* Provide a step-by-step guide on using the collection to test different API functionalities.
* Explain the test assertions and how to interpret the results.
